# AI Voice Cloning

This [repository](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning) and [guide](https://rentry.org/AI-Voice-Cloning/) aims to provide a comprehensive setup for AI voice cloning tools for legitimate, local use on both Windows and Linux systems. It also serves as a resource for individuals interested in experimenting with [TorToiSe](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).

Like my previous findings with Stable Diffusion image generation, this guide may seem somewhat unstructured as I document my new experiences with TorToiSe. Please be patient if certain sections feel disjointed or confusing.

> You're welcome to do so, but TorToiSe is proving to be a promising tool, especially with fine-tuning capabilities on the horizon.

**Note:** This project is not endorsed by [neonbjb](https://github.com/neonbjb/). I do not anticipate any ethical issues arising, as the primary intention here is to create humorous video game characters saying amusing lines.
